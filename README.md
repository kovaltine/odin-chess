#The Odin Project: Chess

This is the final project for the Ruby programming stream of The Odin Project. 

This is a command line chess game where two players can play against each other. The outline for the game are as follows:
1. prevent illegal moves
2. board can be saved at any time
3. include testing for important functions
4. write the code as clean as possible
5. Program tells user check and checkmate in the appropriate situations
6. switch the board around depending on your colour

Optional upgrade: build a simple AI that does a random legal move
